Stupid simple blogging  

Genablog is a very simple blogging tool.  It can be used to manage html/css/javascript blogs that do not require a database backend.  

This is primarily a personal project, but the code is open source in case others find it useful.  Do not expect many features to be added to Genablog, and I may not accept many pull requests.  I am intentionally keeping it simple, so If you are need of something more powerful, feel free to check out the many other blogging tools available.

See "genablog help all" for instructions on how to use this software.
